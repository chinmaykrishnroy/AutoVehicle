# Autonomous Vehicle

Welcome to the Autonomous Vehicle Project Repository! This project aims to develop a fully autonomous vehicle capable of navigating its environment, avoiding obstacles, and reaching its destination without human intervention. This README.md file provides an overview of the project, including hardware requirements, safety features, modes of operation, control algorithms, calibration procedures, potential usages, and instructions for getting started.

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi or similar microcontroller
- Motorized vehicle chassis
- Motor drivers (e.g., H-bridge or motor controller)
- Sensors (e.g., ultrasonic sensors, LiDAR, cameras)
- Power source (e.g., batteries)
- Communication modules (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth)
- Miscellaneous components (e.g., wires, connectors)

## Safety Features

- **Obstacle Detection**: Sensors are used to detect obstacles and prevent collisions.
- **Emergency Stop Button**: A physical or software-based emergency stop button is implemented to halt the vehicle's movement in case of emergencies.
- **Fail-Safe Mechanism**: In the event of system failure or loss of communication, the vehicle is programmed to execute predetermined safety protocols, such as stopping or returning to a safe location.

## Modes of Operation

1. **Autonomous Mode**: The vehicle operates autonomously, using onboard sensors and algorithms to navigate its environment and reach its destination.
2. **Manual Mode**: Users can switch to manual control mode to manually drive the vehicle using a remote control or smartphone application.
3. **Mixed Control Mode**: This mode combines autonomous and manual control, allowing users to intervene and provide guidance when necessary.

## Control Algorithms

- **Path Planning**: Algorithms are implemented to plan the vehicle's route from its current location to the desired destination while avoiding obstacles.
- **PID Control**: Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control is used to regulate the vehicle's speed and direction, ensuring smooth and stable movement.
- **Computer Vision**: Computer vision algorithms are employed to detect and recognize objects in the vehicle's environment, providing input for navigation and decision-making.

## Calibration Procedures

- **Sensor Calibration**: Sensors are calibrated to ensure accurate distance measurements and object detection.
- **PID Tuning**: PID controller parameters are tuned to optimize the vehicle's performance, taking into account factors such as weight, terrain, and desired speed.

## Potential Usages

- **Transportation**: Autonomous vehicles can be used for transportation of goods and passengers in various industries, including logistics, agriculture, and public transportation.
- **Surveillance**: Autonomous vehicles equipped with cameras and sensors can be deployed for surveillance and security purposes, patrolling designated areas and monitoring for intruders or anomalies.
- **Exploration**: Autonomous vehicles can explore and map unknown or hazardous environments, such as disaster zones or extraterrestrial landscapes.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Assemble Hardware**: Connect the necessary components as per the provided schematics and instructions.
2. **Install Software**: Install the required libraries and dependencies on the microcontroller and any other computing devices used in the project.
3. **Configure Settings**: Configure the vehicle's parameters, such as speed limits, navigation algorithms, and communication protocols.
4. **Test and Calibration**: Test the vehicle's functionality in a controlled environment and calibrate sensors and controllers as needed for optimal performance.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the vehicle in real-world scenarios and continue to monitor and fine-tune its performance based on feedback and observations.
